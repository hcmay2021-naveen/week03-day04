                            <h2>Mass transfrer operations-I by robert trebyl</h2>
                            <p>My purpose in presenting the third edition of this book continues to be that of
                            the previous edition: "to provide a vehicle for teaching, either through a formal
                            course or through self-study, the techniques of, and principles of equipment
                            design for, the mass-transfer operations of chemical engineering." As before,
                            these operations are largely the responsibility of the chemical engineer, but
                            increasingly practitioners of other e!lgineering disciplines are finding them
                            necessary for their work. This is ~~pecially true for those engaged in pollution
                            control and environment protection, where separation processes predominate,
                            and in, for example, extractive metallurgy, where more sophisticated and diverse
                            methods of separation are increasingly relied upon.</p>
                            <p>I have taken this opportunity to improve and modernize many of the
                            explanations, to modernize the design data, and to lighten the writing as best I
                            could. There are now included discussions of such topics as the surface-stretch
                            theory of mass-transfer, transpiration cooling, new types of tray towers, heatless
                            adsorbers, and the like. Complete design methods are presented for mixer-settler
                            and sieve-tray extractors, sparged vessels, and mechanically agitated vessels for
                            gas-liquid, liquid-liquid, and solid-liquid contact, adiabatic packed-tower absorbers,
                            and evaporative coolers</p>
